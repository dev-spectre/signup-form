## Note

I have used `:has()` selector in css which is not fully supported in Firefox as of now (21 Aug 2023). If you are on Firefox and want to enable `:has()` selector follow bellow steps.

1) Type `about:config` in address bar and press `Enter`.
2) Search `layout.css.has-selector.enabled`.
3) Switch it to `true`.
